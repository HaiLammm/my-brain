## 16. Unified Order Workflow

If no measurements exist, the system redirects to the Appointment Booking page. If measurements exist, the system displays the measurement summary with last-updated timestamp for customer confirmation or re-measurement request.
- **FR83 (Service-Type Payment):** System supports 3 payment modes by service type: Buy (100% upfront payment), Rent (Deposit + CCCD or Security Deposit), Bespoke (Deposit only).

- **FR90 (Security Return on Rental Close):** For rental orders, the system returns the security deposit (cash) or CCCD to the customer after the returned product passes Owner's condition inspection (Good/Damaged/Lost).

## 17. Technical Pattern Generation & Production Export

- **FR92 (Pattern Generation):** System generates 3 technical pattern pieces (front bodice, back bodice, sleeve) from 10 body measurements using deterministic formulas. Geometric deviation from tailor-validated reference patterns < 1mm.
- **FR93 (Curve Generation):** System generates armhole curves (1/4 ellipse arc) and sleeve cap curves (1/2 ellipse arc) matching tailor-validated contours.
- **FR94 (SVG Export):** System exports each pattern piece as SVG at 1:1 scale — printed output matches physical measurements within ±0.5mm tolerance.
- **FR95 (G-code Export):** System exports pattern pieces as G-code for laser cutting with closed paths, cut sequence, and configurable speed/power parameters.
- **FR96 (Pattern Preview):** System displays real-time SVG preview in split-pane layout (measurement input left, pattern preview right) — preview updates within 500ms of measurement change.
- **FR97 (Pattern-Order Attachment):** Owner attaches a completed pattern session to an order when assigning a tailor task. Tailor receives order with linked pattern pieces.
- **FR98 (Tailor Pattern View):** Tailor views attached pattern pieces in order/task detail page with zoom and pan interaction.
- **FR99 (Measurement Validation):** System validates all 10 measurements against min/max ranges before pattern generation. Invalid measurements display specific error messages with acceptable range.

## 18. Status Transition & Audit Trail
- **FR100 (Order Transition Log):** System records every order status change as an immutable event: from_status, to_status, changed_by (user_id), changed_at (timestamp), context (optional note). Current order status is derived from the most recent transition. Covers `status`, `payment_status`, and `preparation_step` fields.
- **FR101 (Payment Transition Log):** System records every payment status change (on `order_payments`) as an event with actor, timestamp, gateway_ref, and failure reason (if applicable). Supports CSKH query: "customer attempted payment N times, timeout at attempt 2."
- **FR102 (Task Transition Log):** System records tailor task `status` and `production_step` transitions with actor and timestamp. Enables SLA tracking: "average time from cutting to sewing."
- **FR103 (Garment Lifecycle Log):** System records garment status transitions (Available → Rented → Maintenance → Available) with actor and timestamp. Enables: "garment rented N times, in maintenance for M days total."
- **FR104 (Appointment Transition Log):** System records appointment status changes with actor and timestamp. Enables funnel: "N bookings confirmed, M cancelled before visit."
- **FR105 (Lead Journey Log):** System records lead classification changes (Cold → Warm → Hot → Converted) with actor, timestamp, and note. Enables CRM funnel: "average days from Cold to Hot."
- **FR106 (Cross-Entity Analytics):** System supports querying transition history to answer: (a) "How many orders passed through status X this month?", (b) "Average duration from status A to status B", (c) "Orders cancelled after payment vs before payment."
- **FR107 (Remaining Entity Logs):** System records status transitions for pattern_sessions, campaigns, vouchers, notifications, and order_item rental_status with actor and timestamp for audit completeness.
