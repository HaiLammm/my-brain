FR88: System marks orders as ready_to_ship or ready_for_pickup when all preparation sub-steps are complete, and notifies the customer.
FR89: For deposit-based orders, customers pay the remaining balance (order total minus deposit) before product handover.
FR90: For rental orders, the system returns the security deposit (cash) or CCCD to the customer after the returned product passes Owner's condition inspection (Good/Damaged/Lost).

**Section 17: Technical Pattern Generation & Production Export**
FR91: Owner creates a pattern session by selecting a customer profile; system auto-fills 10 body measurements from the customer's measurement record.
FR92: System generates 3 technical pattern pieces (front bodice, back bodice, sleeve) from 10 body measurements using deterministic formulas. Geometric deviation from tailor-validated reference patterns < 1mm.
FR93: System generates armhole curves (1/4 ellipse arc) and sleeve cap curves (1/2 ellipse arc) matching tailor-validated contours.
FR94: System exports each pattern piece as SVG at 1:1 scale — printed output matches physical measurements within +/-0.5mm tolerance.
FR95: System exports pattern pieces as G-code for laser cutting with closed paths, cut sequence, and configurable speed/power parameters.
FR96: System displays real-time SVG preview in split-pane layout (measurement input left, pattern preview right) — preview updates within 500ms of measurement change.
FR97: Owner attaches a completed pattern session to an order when assigning a tailor task. Tailor receives order with linked pattern pieces.
FR98: Tailor views attached pattern pieces in order/task detail page with zoom and pan interaction.

### Epic 12: AI Style & Semantic Interpretation (Deferred — Post E-commerce Launch)
Users can select Style Pillars, adjust style intensity via Sliders, system translates selections into Ease Delta parameters, and suggests compatible fabrics.
**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4

### Epic 13: AI Geometric Transformation Engine (Deferred — Post E-commerce Launch)
System applies Ease Delta to Golden Base Pattern, calculates new coordinates from body measurements, generates Master Geometry Specification, and exports Blueprint SVG.
**FRs covered:** FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8

### Epic 14: AI Guardrails, Tailor Collaboration & Production (Deferred — Post E-commerce Launch)
System enforces physical constraints and Golden Rules, issues warnings near limits, allows tailor manual override. Tailors use Overlay comparison, Sanity Check Dashboard, and receive adjustment parameter lists. System secures Golden Rules knowledge access.
**FRs covered:** FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR15, FR16

### Epic 15: Status Transition & Business Event Tracking
System records every status change across all entities as immutable business events with actor, timestamp, and context — applying the "Video, Not Snapshot" principle. Enables conversion funnel analytics (Marketing), cash flow reconciliation (Accounting), cancellation phase analysis (Management), SLA/bottleneck tracking (Operations), and full order timeline for customer service. Transition history is the source of truth; current status is derived/cached.

**Stories:**

**Story 15.1: Foundation — Transition Infrastructure**
- Create 6 Tier 1+2 transition tables (order_status_transitions, order_payment_transitions, tailor_task_transitions, garment_status_transitions, appointment_status_transitions, lead_status_transitions) with common schema (id, tenant_id, entity_id, field_name, from_status, to_status, changed_by, changed_at, context, metadata JSONB)
- Create composite indexes per architecture spec (entity_id+changed_at DESC, to_status+changed_at, changed_by+changed_at)
- Implement base `record_transition()` service method with DB transaction atomicity (transition insert + entity status update in same commit)
- FRs: FR100, FR101, FR102, FR103, FR104, FR105

**Story 15.2: Tier 1 Integration — Orders & Payments**
- Refactor all order status mutations in order service to use `record_transition()`
- Refactor payment status mutations (order_payments)
- Cover: status, payment_status, preparation_step fields
- Backfill: create initial transition record for existing orders from created_at timestamp
- Unit tests: verify every order workflow path records transitions
- FRs: FR100, FR101

**Story 15.3: Tier 1 Integration — Tailor Tasks**
- Refactor task status + production_step mutations to use `record_transition()`
- Backfill existing tasks
- Unit tests for task lifecycle transitions
- FR: FR102

**Story 15.4: Tier 2 Integration — Garments, Appointments, Leads**
- Refactor garment status, appointment status, lead classification mutations
- Backfill existing records
- Unit tests
- FRs: FR103, FR104, FR105

**Story 15.5: Tier 3 Integration — Remaining Entities**
- Create 5 remaining transition tables (pattern_session_transitions, campaign_status_transitions, voucher_status_transitions, notification_status_transitions, order_item_rental_transitions)
- Refactor status mutations for each
- Backfill existing records
- FR: FR107

**Story 15.6: Transition History API**
- Implement per-entity transition GET endpoints (orders/{id}/transitions, tailor-tasks/{id}/transitions, garments/{id}/transitions, appointments/{id}/transitions, leads/{id}/transitions)
- Implement analytics endpoints (orders/funnel, orders/cancellation-analysis, orders/stage-duration, tailor-tasks/productivity)
- Authorization: Customer sees own order transitions only, Owner sees all, Tailor sees own task transitions
- FR: FR106

**Story 15.7: Frontend — OrderTimeline Upgrade & Analytics Components**
- Upgrade OrderTimeline component to render from real transition data (Compact + Expanded + Customer variants)
- Build FunnelChart component (conversion funnel visualization for Marketing)
- Build StageMetrics component (avg duration per stage for Operations/BGĐ)
- Integrate into Owner Dashboard
- FRs: FR106 (UI layer)

**Dependencies:**
- Story 15.1 blocks all other stories
- Stories 15.2-15.5 can be parallelized after 15.1
- Story 15.6 depends on 15.2-15.5
- Story 15.7 depends on 15.6

**Implementation Note:** Epic 15 is independent of epic sequencing — can begin at any time since transition tables are purely additive. Recommended: start after current sprint completes, prioritize Stories 15.1 → 15.2 → 15.3 for immediate Tier 1 value.
